# PUI2017 HW 5.

### Collaborators
This time, no one specific, maybe Sunglyoung Kim (we both looked at the same stackoverflow question and talked about it). I wrote all code myself in general, though. As usual I helped people with their own code in various capacities but nothing that I'd rmark on.


### Assignment 1 Summary
I sampled from a beta distribution and once again showed that the central limit theorem works


### Assignment 2 Summary
I followed the outline and showed convergence of 2 distributions (binomial, poisson) with normality as we increase the distributions' mean parameter under 3 tests: KL, AD, KS. 


### Assignment 3 Summary
I followed the outline and generated the required plots to discover that the USA is bad with gun violence. I am especially proud of the error bars on the # of homicides with gun per capita vs. GDP plot.
