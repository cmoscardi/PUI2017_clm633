#### Hi Christian,
#### I understand that you have tried to plot the income of regions based on departure and arrival locations of taxi trips and have linked the payment type to it. 
#### Below are a few suggestions that you could incorporate to make this visual more appealing:

####      1.	Also, there is a lot of data points that makes it difficult to derive any correlation, it would have been better to down sample the data even further. 
####      2.	The caption is more like a detailed description, you could have provided a short caption like- “Taxi Fare payment type plotted based on the income of origin and destination of Taxi Trips “
####      3.	It would have been nice if you could have chosen a visualization that showed some correlation or follows a pattern.
#### Best,
#### Praveen
